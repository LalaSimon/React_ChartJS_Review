# React-ChartJS 2 - React chart library

![Logo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:724/1*KW0vhD3esJFO7AYcf7Z_pQ.png)

# Description

A resistant, poorly editable library. Few elements are editable; the charts, grid, and x and y axes cannot be edited. The documentation is hopeless, mostly based on class programming. Only some attributes are sensibly explained in the sandbox, but not all of them are mentioned.

Definetly the best part of this library are Radar and Polar Area Charts.
